#
#	Set the following 4 variables.  The host system is the system where
#	the software will be built; the target system is where it will run.
#	They are almost always the same.

#	On Nt systems, the ROOT path MUST be of the form `drive:/path'
#
#       ROOT must be a hardcoded value because nested mkfiles would reexpande it
ROOT=/tmp/inferno64-dad

#
#	Specify the flavour of Tk (std for standard builds)
#
TKSTYLE=std

# emu target, emu-g is a headless variant. Linux/BSD only (emu, emu-g)
CONF=emu-g

#	binary will be placed at $SYSTARG/$OBJTYPE/bin/$CONF

#
#	Except for building kernels, SYSTARG must always be the same as SYSHOST
#
SYSHOST=Linux		# build system OS type (Hp, Inferno, Irix, Linux, MacOSX, Nt, Plan9, Solaris)
SYSTARG=$SYSHOST	# target system OS type (Hp, Inferno, Irix, Linux, Nt, Plan9, Solaris)

#
#	specify the architecture of the target system - Plan 9 imports it from the
#	environment; for other systems it is usually just hard-coded
#
#OBJTYPE=386			# target system object type (eg, 386, arm, mips, power, s800, sparc)
OBJTYPE=amd64

#
#	no changes required beyond this point
#
OBJDIR=$SYSTARG/$OBJTYPE

<$ROOT/mkfiles/mkhost-$SYSHOST			# variables appropriate for host system
<$ROOT/mkfiles/mkfile-$SYSTARG-$OBJTYPE	# variables used to build target object type
